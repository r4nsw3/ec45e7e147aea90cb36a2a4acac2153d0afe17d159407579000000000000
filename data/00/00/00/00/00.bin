  |   Dash across the map and rescue wobbly citizens in wacky ways in The   |
  |   Stretchers on Nintendo Switch! Team up with a friend and let the      |
  |   frantic fun ensue as you avoid traps and solve puzzles while          |
  |   helping those who need a hand!                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Rescue injured civilians, known as Dizzies, from all kinds of         |
  |   bizarre situations! Drive to each scene in your ambulance - but be    |
  |   prepared, it won't be a smooth ride. Break through walls, soar        |
  |   through the sky and face other wild perils on your way to each        |
  |   rescue!                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Once you arrive at a scene, find as many Dizzies as you can and       |
  |   bring them back to the ambulance. Together, you'll need to pile       |
  |   Dizzies up on your stretcher - or grab them by the limbs - and head   |
  |   back to your trusty vehicle, dodging dangers and cracking             |
  |   conundrums along the way. Move furniture to block zapping lasers,     |
  |   use wrecking balls to destroy walls, and more! If solo lifting's      |
  |   your thing, go right ahead - but keep in mind, many hands make        |
  |   lighter work.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   When everyone's ready to go, hurtle across town in another            |
  |   thrill-filled road trip to a machine called the De-Dizzler 3000 in    |
  |   order to cure the rescued Dizzies!                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Found all the Dizzies in a scene? Great! Before you decide to hit     |
  |   the gas though, you may want to snoop around to earn achievements     |
  |   and find the bonus treasures tucked away in each Rescue Mission.      |
  |   Doing so will net you a higher mission score, as well as fill up      |
  |   your Sticker Book with...well...stickers! Can you collect 'em all?    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Luckily for you, the ambulance won't take damage from any knocks      |
  |   and bumps, and it can even be powered-up with some nifty upgrades.    |
  |   Cut corners by gliding through the air, sailing through seas, or      |
  |   simply speed-boosting over the land!                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Tackle Upgrade Missions with each upgrade you unlock by outracing     |
  |   emails that zip across telephone lines! While one player grabs the    |
  |   wheel, the other makes use of the flashy new gizmo to reach the       |
  |   goal first.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Customise your medic from the very start, and unlock more hats and    |
  |   outfits along the way via Side Missions. These range from sawing      |
  |   down trees to building ramps, blowing up rocks with fireworks, and    |
  |   even games of hide-and-seek! You can also customise your Home Base    |
  |   with all kinds of furniture elements, like an Arcade Machine that     |
  |   lets you replay missions to find those missed treasures and earn      |
  |   that perfect score.                                                   |
